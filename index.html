    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Credit card Fraud detection using Data mining</h3>
    <p>
      The main goal of this project is to identify suspicious events and report them to an analyst while allowing normal transactions to be handled automatically. This project was implemented using Isolation Forest, Local Outlier factor, K-Neighbors, and Logistic Regression models.
    </p>

    <h3>Deep Learning for Web-Based Malaria Parasite Detection in Thick Blood Smears</h3>
    <p>
      Deep learning method that can detect malaria parasites in thick blood smear images and can run on the web. Our method first does the image preprocessing and then a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifies each candidate as either parasite or background.
